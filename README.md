## Predict sleep efficiency from PSG data of Parkinson's patients with obstructive sleep apnea ##
I am not sure how to go about this, as this is a small and noisy dataset, but let's see what we can do. 
Sleep efficiency is a variable that can be easily computed once PSG data has been scored by a technician,
but as I don't have time to score all my data, I am hoping to use ML algorithm to score sleep (i.e., assign sleep stages; N1, N2, N3, REM) to then derive sleep efficiency. 

There are many challenges to this: first, sleep is heavily "impaired" in this population and individuals vary greatly from one another so it increasingly hard to draw patterns from the data. 

[This is a first pass idea for now]
